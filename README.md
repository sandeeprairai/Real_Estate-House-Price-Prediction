## Introduction

The Real Estate House Price Prediction Project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the prices of houses based on several factors. Predicting house prices accurately can be valuable for real estate investors, buyers, and sellers, enabling them to make informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various real estate properties, including features like size, location, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms, as well as the corresponding prices. This dataset is crucial for training and testing our machine learning models.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features and transform data to improve model performance.

3. **Model Selection**: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, etc., to identify the best-performing model.

4. **Model Training**: Train the selected model using the preprocessed data.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean absolute error, mean squared error, etc., to assess its accuracy.

6. **Prediction**: Utilize the trained model to predict house prices for new data.
